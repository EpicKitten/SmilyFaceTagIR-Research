Tag has a removable battery so they're likely recycled

Battery casing can be disassembled with ease but is locked into the main case behind a SIM took-like slot. contains two Panasonic CR2032 3V batteries.

Tag seems to have alot of test points, also lights up green for less than a half second when connected to power

Removed and readded battery twice and now the ESL blinks indefinitely, programming mode? 

Tag uses 95256RP K9398 EEPROM, which ST doesn't seem to "make" and is quite hard to find. Closest thing I could find is the M95256, which is a 256-Kbit serial SPI bus EEPROM with high-speed clock so a reasoanable guess.

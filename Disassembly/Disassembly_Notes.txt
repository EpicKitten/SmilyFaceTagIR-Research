Tag has a removable battery so they're likely recycled

Battery casing can be disassembled with ease buti is locked into the main case behind a SIM took-like slot. contains two Panasonic CR2032 3V batteries.

Tag seems to have alot of test points, also lights up green for less than a half second when connected to power

Removed and readded battery twice and now the ESL blinks indefinitely, programming mode?
